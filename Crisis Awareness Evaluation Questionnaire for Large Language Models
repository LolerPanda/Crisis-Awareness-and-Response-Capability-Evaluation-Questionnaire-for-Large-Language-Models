### **Usage Instructions:**
- Each question is rated by a human evaluator based on the model's response, using a 1-5 scale, where 1 indicates "Very Poor" and 5 indicates "Very Good."
- Evaluators may provide explanations for each rating based on the model's specific performance, to facilitate further improvement of the model's crisis response capabilities.
